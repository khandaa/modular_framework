# Product Requirements Document: Modular Software Framework

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The Modular Software Framework (MSF) is a comprehensive, microservice-inspired architecture designed to create reusable, independent software modules that can be seamlessly integrated into various applications. This framework aims to solve the common problem of redundant code development across projects by providing a standardized approach to building pluggable modules that handle specific functionalities, from backend services to API endpoints and frontend components.

Using SQLite for data storage, Flask for API development, and React for frontend components, this framework will enable software developers to rapidly build applications by assembling pre-built, tested, and documented modules rather than developing every component from scratch.

## 2. Goals

- Create a modular architecture that supports independent, pluggable software components
- Enable microservice-like scalability for each module
- Standardize module development across backend (Flask/Python), database (SQLite), and frontend (React)
- Reduce development time for new applications by 40-60%
- Ensure modules can communicate with each other efficiently through events
- Maintain independence of modules to allow for individual deployment and scaling
- Support containerization of each module via Docker
- Establish clear documentation and versioning standards

## 3. User Stories

- As a developer, I want to quickly import an authentication module so that I don't have to rebuild login functionality.
- As a developer, I want to integrate user management functionality into my application without writing code from scratch.
- As a developer, I want modules to handle their own database requirements so I don't need to design database schemas for common functionalities.
- As a developer, I want to easily update individual modules without affecting the entire application.
- As a developer, I want consistent API patterns across modules so I can predict how to use any module without extensive documentation reading.
- As a developer, I want to be able to override default module behaviors when needed for specific application requirements.
- As a developer, I want modules to be well-tested so I can trust their reliability in my applications.
- As a developer, I want to understand module dependencies clearly to avoid unexpected issues.
- As a developer, I want to easily incorporate role-based access control without implementing complex permission systems.
- As a developer, I want modules to have standardized error handling so I can consistently manage errors across my application.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Core Framework Architecture

1. The framework must provide a standardized structure for module development that works across backend, database, and frontend components.
2. The framework must include clear templates and examples for creating new modules.
3. The framework must define standard interfaces for module communication.
4. The framework must support event-based communication between modules.
5. Each module must be independently deployable as a Docker container.
6. The framework must include tooling for module discovery and dependency management.

### Module Development Standards

7. Each module must include comprehensive documentation including purpose, dependencies, API endpoints, and usage examples.
8. Each module must have a standardized versioning system following semantic versioning principles.
9. Each module must include automated tests covering critical functionality.
10. Each module must handle its own database migrations and schema management.
11. Each module must implement standardized error handling and logging.
12. Each module must include health check endpoints for monitoring.

### Initial Module Requirements: User Management

13. The system must provide a User Management module that handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
14. The User Management module must support multiple authentication methods (email/password, OAuth providers).
15. The User Management module must include role-based access control functionality.
16. The User Management module must provide session management capabilities.
17. The User Management module must offer both backend API and frontend components for common user flows.
18. The User Management module must securely store user credentials using industry-standard encryption.
19. The User Management module must provide endpoints for password reset and account recovery.
20. The User Management module must include admin interfaces for user management.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Creating a monolithic application framework
- Supporting programming languages outside of Python (backend) and JavaScript/React (frontend)
- Building modules specific to particular business domains (e.g., e-commerce-specific modules)
- Providing hosting or deployment infrastructure beyond Docker containerization
- Supporting database systems other than SQLite in the initial version
- Automating the composition of modules into complete applications

## 6. Design Considerations

- Each module should follow consistent design patterns for both backend API endpoints and frontend components.
- Frontend components should be built using Material UI to ensure consistency.
- APIs should follow RESTful design principles with clear documentation.
- Database models should use consistent naming conventions across modules.
- Event communication should use a standardized message format.
- All interfaces should be responsive and mobile-friendly.

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Backend (Flask/Python)

- Each module should be structured as a Flask Blueprint for easy integration.
- Use Flask-RESTful or similar extensions for standardizing API development.
- Implement proper error handling and validation for all API endpoints.
- Include database migrations for each module using Alembic.
- Support environment-based configuration for flexibility.

### Database (SQLite)

- Define clear database modeling standards.
- Include migration scripts for each module.
- Ensure proper indexing for performance.
- Implement connection pooling for scalability.
- Define standard approaches to handle relationships between entities across modules.

### Frontend (React/Material UI)

- Create reusable React components that are easily stylable.
- Implement state management using a consistent library.
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all components.
- Support theming and customization options.
- Include responsive design considerations.

### Containerization/Deployment

- Each module should include a Dockerfile for containerization.
- Define standards for environment variables and configurations.
- Include health check endpoints for container orchestration systems.
- Consider lightweight container options for better performance.

## 8. Success Metrics

- 50% reduction in development time for standard features like user authentication and management
- 90% or higher test coverage for all modules
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities in released modules
- Successful adoption of the framework for at least 3 internal projects
- 30% reduction in code maintenance costs for features using the modular framework
- Positive developer feedback regarding ease of use and integration

## 9. Open Questions

- Should the framework include a centralized service registry for module discovery? yes
- How will versioning conflicts between interdependent modules be managed? new versions should support backward compatibility
- What monitoring and observability standards should be established across modules? use standard monitoring product like ELK
- Should there be a standardized approach to handle distributed transactions across modules? use kafka commit log 
- How will the framework handle module updates and migrations in production environments? - think about it
